                <p>
                    Nearpod is an interactive instructional platform that helps teachers create engaging, student-centered lessons. It allows educators to integrate multimedia content, quizzes, polls, and interactive activities into their lessons, keeping students actively involved. Nearpod supports real-time formative assessment, enabling teachers to check for understanding and adjust instruction as needed. For students, it provides an interactive and personalized learning experience, accommodating different learning styles. Whether used for whole-class instruction, small groups, or independent practice, Nearpod enhances student engagement and makes learning more dynamic.

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>
                One of the best things about using technology for instruction and assessments is the ability for students to work at their own pace and progress through material when they are ready. Programs like Nearpod make it easy to differentiate instruction by assigning different videos or questions based on individual student needs which supports ISTE Standard 7.b. It also provides a way for teachers to track student's progress in real-time, seeing who has watched the video, how much time they spent on it and how well they performed. In addition, the teacher can give oral or written feedback within the lesson giving students one-on-one attention and guided instruction. For many students, this alternative to paper and pencil work can engage and motivate students and supports the ISTE Standard 7.a by offering alternative assessments.
