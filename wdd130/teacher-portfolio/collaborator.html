                <h4>Title: How and Why are Educators Using Instagram. An Article by Carpenter, Morrison, and Lee, 2020.</h4>
                <p>
                    Educators have found that social media can be a valuable resource to share ideas and network with others. The article titled "How and Why are Educators Using Instagram?" authored by Jeffrey P. Carpenter, Scott A. Morrison, Madeline Craft, and Michalene Lee explores the ways in which educators are utilizing the popular social media platform, Instagram, and the motivations driving their use. The authors investigate the various reasons teachers have for using Instagram as a resource and found that educators are connecting globally with other educators to share teaching practices, such as enhancing classroom engagement, fostering creativity, and connecting with students in a more relatable manner.

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>
                I rarely use social media so the idea of it being a way to network with other professionals was intriguing to me. The article provided me with good information about how I might use Instagram (and other platforms) as a networking tool to help me improve as a teacher. As a result, I created a Twitter account where I have been able to connect to a broader network of learners, professionals, and resources. ISTE Standard 4.c. encourages the use of collaborative tools to expand my educational circle of influence to include a diverse range of ideas, practices, and viewpoints from around the world. But it can be used for more than teacher collaboration. ISTE Standard 4.c includes providing students with authentic real-world experiences by engaging virtually with others. I have learned that Instagram is one of many sources to help students do this. Using common hashtags, students can share their contirbutuions on a collaboartive project sharing multimedia content related to a specific topic or project. Instagram can also be used to share virtual field trips, behind-the-scenes experiences, or industry insights. This can include live or recorded tours, interviews, and demonstrations, allowing students to explore real-world settings and learn from professionals in various fields.
