            <p>
                This article nurtures meaningful connection for families and supports the creative expression of ISTE Standard 6.d. Delivering age-appropriate, interactive lessons that foster curiosity, creativity, and a love for learning using a virtual platform supports ISTE Standard 6.b. Daily story time is an activity featured in the article, promising it to be the highlight of the preschool day. Using interactive technology such as Zoom will allows teachers to create this magical experience where students have fun, and develop early reading and language skills. I watched several videos of teachers delivering educational content through technology. I was impressed to see that even in virtual formats, students do more than watch the teacher on the screen. They interact, answer questions, and receive feedback.
