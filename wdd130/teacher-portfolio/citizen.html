                <h4>Title: Digital Citizenship and Social Media, a Doodly Presentation, by Rachel Young, 2023.</h4>
                <p>
                    Teaching students about safety while using social media is crucial in today's digital age. Social media platforms offer various opportunities for communication, collaboration, and learning, but they also present potential risks. I created this video to provide students with information and guidelines to keep them safe while using platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat. While many students access these platforms on a daily basis, few of them actually understand the terms and conditions they agreed to when they created their account. In this video I highlight the "small print", the terms and conditions that are often overlooked.

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>
                Preventative measures are often a focus of digital citizenship as indicated in the video presentation I created and by ISTE Standards 3.c and 3.d. I feel these performance indicators are important, but I have also learned that teaching resilience and how to proactively spread positivity in an online context is equally important as indicated by 3.a. As a parent of teenagers, I have learned how quickly a post, a video, a chat, or message can affect them - for better or worse. As a future educator I can expand digital citizenship to include resilient strategies for dealing with online negativity, hate speech, online conflicts, and other emotional challenges connected to a digital social life as well as information about how to create proactive online experiences that spread positivity and make our world a better place. Instilling all the ISTE performance indicators of digital citizenship helps students become responsible, ethical, and respectful online participants. This includes understanding the consequences of their actions, respecting others' rights, and contributing positively to the online community.
