            <h4>Title: Narrative Writing and Narrative Art, a Powerpoint created by Rachel Young, 2023.</h4>
            <p>
                This powerpoint is central to a flipped lesson plan I created integrating standards in ELA and Visual Arts. In a flipped lesson plan, traditional teaching methods are reversed. Students are introduced to new content at home or independently at school through videos or other materials, and classroom time is then used for activities, discussions, and application of the learned concepts. This powerpoint connecting narrative writing and narrative art would be viewed by students independently and previous to the lesson.

            <p>
                This lesson plan and powerpoint supports ISTSE Standard 5.b by designing an authentic learning activity that is aligned with the content area standards of ELA and Visual Arts. The video is intended to be used as a resource within the lesson to deliver content so that time in the classroom can be devoted to active learning activities, such as discussions, problem-solving, and collaborative projects. This hands-on approach fosters better understanding of the material and supports the active, deep learning of ISTE Standard 5.b. In the flipped lesson plan students can learn at their own pace and review the powerpoint as needed. Those who grasp concepts quickly can move ahead, while others who need more time can take it without feeling rushed which supports ISTE Standard 5.a accommodating learner differences and needs.
