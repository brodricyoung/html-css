      <strong>Professional Teacher Portfolio</strong>
      <p>
        <b>Introduction</b>
        Welcome to my professional teacher portfolio. In these digital pages, I invite you to explore seven learning and instructional standards for educators set by the International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE). These standards have provided a framework for innovative lesson planning, assessments, and collaborative work and they empower me with the knowledge I need to thrive as an educator in a technology-driven world. Throughout the pages, you will find a collection of artifacts, reflections, and evidence of this framework. This portfolio reflects my growth and commitment to the ISTE standards and to creating a nurturing environment for my students that fosters a sense of curiosity and a lifelong love for learning.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Teaching philosophy</b>
        Before I learned to read, I loved listening to my mom read stacks, very large stacks, of books to me every day. This daily ritual not only instilled in me a deep love for stories but also laid the foundation for my educational journey. Story time, as a cherished and formative experience, not only prepared me for the academic challenges of school but also equipped me with essential life skills.
        
      </p>
      <p>
        As an educator, I recognize the enduring value of storytelling and its pivotal role in fostering a love for learning. While my personal connection to story time remains steadfast, I acknowledge that today's learners are navigating a world enriched with a variety of technologies. In this fast-paced, technology-driven era, my philosophy centers on harnessing these tools to enhance instruction and maximize the potential of every student.
      </p>
      <p>
        Understanding that my attitude, actions, and teaching approach significantly influence the learning environment, I embrace the role of an innovative educator. In a landscape marked by rapid growth and constant change, I position myself as a perpetual learner, dedicated to continuous improvement. I view technology not as a substitute for traditional methods but as a powerful tool that, when used effectively, can amplify the learning experience. By weaving together the timeless magic of storytelling with the possibilities afforded by technology, I aim to cultivate not only knowledgeable individuals but lifelong learners who find joy and purpose in their educational journey.

      <h3>Learner</h3>
      <strong>ISTE Standards for Educators 1:  Learner</strong>
      <p>
        Educators continually improve their practice by learning from and with others, and exploring proven and promising practices that leverage technology to boost student learning.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Set Professional Goals</b>
        1.a. Set professional learning goals to explore and apply pedagogical approaches made possible by technology and reflect on their effectiveness. 
        <br>
        <b>Participate in PLNs</b> 
        1.b. Pursue professional interests by creating and actively participating in local and global learning networks. 
        <br>
        <b>Keep Current on Research</b>
        1.c. Stay current with research that supports improved student learning outcomes, including findings from the learning sciences.  
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Artifact</b>
        <br>
        <b>Title: A Framework for Thinking About Tech Integration, an article featured in Edutopia, written by P.E. France, 2020.</b>

        Edutopia, a trusted information source in the educational community, is working to transform education through the use of technology in the classroom. Whether you are an experienced and savvy tech user, or a novice like me, this article provides a framework that can guide your use of technology in the classroom. The author challenges educators to consider the purpose of technology and the importance of utilizing it in ways that will maximize learning while minimizing complexity. Further, the article reminds educators that technology should not distance students, rather it can be a powerful resource in connecting students, teachers, and families. I chose this artifact to serve as a guide for setting professional goals to learn about and use technology in the most effective ways. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>A Framework for Thinking About Tech Integration</b>
        Apps and other digital tools should minimize complexity while prioritizing the authentic connections that are central to learning.

      <h3>Leader</h3>
      <strong>ISTE Standards for Educators 2:  Leader</strong>
      <p>Educators seek out opportunities for leadership to support student empowerment and success and to improve teaching and learning.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Advance a Shared Vision</b>
        2.a. Shape, advance and accelerate a shared vision for empowered learning with technology by engaging with education stakeholders. 
        <br>
        <b>Advocate for Equitable Access</b>
        2.b. Advocate for equitable access to educational technology, digital content and learning opportunities to meet the diverse needs of all students.
        <br>
        <b>Model Digital Tool Use</b>
        2.c. Model for colleagues the identification, exploration, evaluation, curation and adoption of new digital resources and tools for learning. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>My Plan to meet this standard:</b>
        I live in a rural community where many students have limited or no access to the internet and personal electronic devices, such as laptops or tablets at home. A lack of access can hinder a student's ability to engage in online learning and complete digital assignments. But it is more than that. Living rurally means that educational resources, such as libraries, museums, and educational events are also not possible for most students impacting the breadth and depth of their learning experiences. Technology can fill that gap by providing virtual experiences to explore diverse cultures, perspectives, and knowledge without the need for travel. Advocating for equitable access to educational technology and digital content is necessary for ensuring that all students have the opportunity to thrive in the modern learning environment. I can lead out in my own community by gathering data on the current state of access to educational technology for families in my school district. I can identify gaps and disparities in access among different student groups. I will create awareness about the importance of equitable access to educational technology using various channels such as social media, community meetings, and newsletters to inform parents, educators, and policymakers. Further, I can collaborate with local organizations, businesses, and community leaders to build partnerships that can support initiatives for equitable access including technology donations, discounted services, or volunteer programs.
      </p>

      </ul>

      <h3>Citizen</h3>
      <strong>ISTE Standards for Educators 3:  Citizen</strong>
      <p>Educators inspire students to positively contribute to and responsibly participate in the digital world.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Create Positive Experiences</b>
        3.a. Create experiences for learners to make positive, socially responsible contributions and exhibit empathetic behavior online that build relationships and community.
        <br>
        <b>Evaluate Resources for Credibility</b>
        3.b. Establish a learning culture that promotes curiosity and critical examination of online resources, and fosters digital literacy and media fluency.
        <br>
        <b>Teach Safe, Legal, Ethical Practices</b>
        3.c. Mentor students in safe, legal and ethical practices with digital tools and the protection of intellectual rights and property.
        <br>
        <b>Model Digital Privacy</b>
        3.d. Model and promote management of personal data and digital identity, and protect student data privacy.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Artifact</b>
        <br>
        <b>Title: Digital Citizenship and Social Media, a Doodly Presentation, by Rachel Young, 2023.</b>
        Teaching students about safety while using social media is crucial in today's digital age. Social media platforms offer various opportunities for communication, collaboration, and learning, but they also present potential risks. I created this video to provide students with information and guidelines to keep them safe while using platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat. While many students access these platforms on a daily basis, few of them actually understand the terms and conditions they agreed to when they created their account.  In this video I highlight the "small print", the terms and conditions that are often overlooked. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Reflection</b>
        Preventative measures are often a focus of digital citizenship as indicated in the video presentation I created and by ISTE Standards 3.c and 3.d. I feel these performance indicators are important, but I have also learned that teaching resilience and how to proactively spread positivity in an online context is equally important as indicated by 3.a.  As a parent of teenagers, I have learned how quickly a post, a video, a chat, or message can affect them - for better or worse. As a future educator I can expand digital citizenship to include resilient strategies for dealing with online negativity, hate speech, online conflicts, and other emotional challenges connected to a digital social life as well as information about how to create proactive online experiences that spread positivity and make our world a better place. Instilling all the ISTE performance indicators of digital citizenship helps students become responsible, ethical, and respectful online participants. This includes understanding the consequences of their actions, respecting others' rights, and contributing positively to the online community.

      <h3>Collaborator</h3>
      <strong>ISTE Standards for Educators 4:  Collaborator</strong>
      <p>Educators dedicate time to collaborate with both colleagues and students to improve practice, discover and share resources and ideas, and solve problems.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Collaborate with Colleagues</b>
        4.a. Dedicate planning time to collaborate with colleagues to create authentic learning experiences that leverage technology.
        <br>
        <b>Learn Alongside Students</b>
        4.b. Collaborate and co-learn with students to discover and use new digital resources, and diagnose and troubleshoot technology issues.
        <br>
        <b>Use Collaborative Tools</b>
        4.c. Use collaborative tools to expand students' authentic, real-world learning experiences by engaging virtually with experts, teams and students, locally and globally.
        <br>
        <b>Demonstrate Cultural Competency</b>
        4.d. Demonstrate cultural competency when communicating with students, parents and colleagues, and interact with them as co-collaborators in student learning.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Artifact</b>
        <br>
        <b>Title: How and Why are Educators Using Instagram. An Article by Carpenter, Morrison, and Lee, 2020.</b>
        Educators have found that social media can be a valuable resource to share ideas and network with others. The article titled "How and Why are Educators Using Instagram?" authored by Jeffrey P. Carpenter, Scott A. Morrison, Madeline Craft, and Michalene Lee explores the ways in which educators are utilizing the popular social media platform, Instagram, and the motivations driving their use. The authors investigate the various reasons teachers have for using Instagram as a resource and found that educators are connecting globally with other educators to share teaching practices, such as enhancing classroom engagement, fostering creativity, and connecting with students in a more relatable manner.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Reflection</b>
        I rarely use social media so the idea of it being a way to network with other professionals was intriguing to me. The article provided me with good information about how I might use Instagram (and other platforms) as a networking tool to help me improve as a teacher. As a result, I created a Twitter account where I have been able to connect to a broader network of learners, professionals, and resources. ISTE Standard 4.c. encourages the use of collaborative tools to expand my educational circle of influence to include a diverse range of ideas, practices, and viewpoints from around the world. But it can be used for more than teacher collaboration. ISTE Standard 4.c includes providing students with authentic real-world experiences by engaging virtually with others. I have learned that Instagram is one of many sources to help students do this.  Using common hashtags, students can share their contirbutuions on a collaboartive project sharing multimedia content related to a specific topic or project. Instagram can also be used to share virtual field trips, behind-the-scenes experiences, or industry insights. This can include live or recorded tours, interviews, and demonstrations, allowing students to explore real-world settings and learn from professionals in various fields.

      <h3>Designer</h3>
      <strong>ISTE Standards for Educators 5:  Designer</strong>
      <p>Educators design authentic, learner-driven activities and environments that recognize and accommodate learner variability.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Accommodate Learner Differences</b>
        5.a. Use technology to create, adapt and personalize learning experiences that foster independent learning and accommodate learner differences and needs.
        <br>
        <b>Design Authentic Learning Activities</b>
        5.b. Design authentic learning activities that align with content area standards and use digital tools and resources to maximize active, deep learning.
        <br>
        <b>Model Digital Tool Use</b>
        5.c. Explore and apply instructional design principles to create innovative digital learning environments that engage and support learning. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Artifact</b>
        <br>
        <b>Title: Narrative Writing and Narrative Art, a Powerpoint created by Rachel Young, 2023.</b>
        This powerpoint is central to a flipped lesson plan I created integrating standards in ELA and Visual Arts. In a flipped lesson plan, traditional teaching methods are reversed. Students are introduced to new content at home or independently at school through videos or other materials, and classroom time is then used for activities, discussions, and application of the learned concepts. This powerpoint connecting narrative writing and narrative art would be viewed by students independently and previous to the lesson. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Reflection</b>
        This lesson plan and powerpoint supports ISTSE Standard 5.b by designing an authentic learning activity that is aligned with the content area standards of ELA and Visual Arts. The video is intended to be  used as a resource within the lesson to deliver content so that time in the classroom can be devoted to active learning activities, such as discussions, problem-solving, and collaborative projects. This hands-on approach fosters better understanding of the material and supports the active, deep learning of ISTE Standard 5.b.  In the flipped lesson plan students can learn at their own pace and review the powerpoint as needed. Those who grasp concepts quickly can move ahead, while others who need more time can take it without feeling rushed which supports ISTE Standard 5.a accommodating learner differences and needs.

Four important features of online learning are shared in this article which educates parents and families in what they can expect from this unique experience including interactive Learning, flexible schedules, parent engagement, and a supportive learning community. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Reflection</b>
        This article nurtures meaningful connection for families and supports the creative expression of ISTE Standard 6.d.  Delivering age-appropriate, interactive lessons that foster curiosity, creativity, and a love for learning using a virtual platform  supports ISTE Standard 6.b.  Daily story time is an activity featured in the article, promising it to be the highlight of the preschool day. Using interactive technology such as Zoom will allows teachers  to create this magical experience where students have fun, and develop early reading and language skills. I watched several videos of teachers delivering educational content through technology. I was impressed to see that even in virtual formats, students do more than watch the teacher on the screen. They interact, answer questions, and receive feedback.

        <b>Reflection</b>
        One of the best things about using technology for instruction and assessments is the ability for students to work at their own pace and progress through material when they are ready. Programs like Nearpod make it easy to differentiate instruction by assigning different videos or questions based on individual student needs which supports ISTE Standard 7.b. It also provides a way for teachers to track student's progress in real-time, seeing who has watched the video, how much time they spent on it and how well they performed. In addition, the teacher can give oral or written feedback within the lesson giving students one-on-one attention and guided instruction. For many students, this alternative to paper and pencil work can engage and motivate students and supports the ISTE Standard 7.a by offering alternative assessments.
