            <h2>My Plan to meet this standard:</h2>
            <p>
                I live in a rural community where many students have limited or no access to the internet and personal electronic devices, such as laptops or tablets at home. A lack of access can hinder a student's ability to engage in online learning and complete digital assignments. But it is more than that. Living rurally means that educational resources, such as libraries, museums, and educational events are also not possible for most students impacting the breadth and depth of their learning experiences. Technology can fill that gap by providing virtual experiences to explore diverse cultures, perspectives, and knowledge without the need for travel. Advocating for equitable access to educational technology and digital content is necessary for ensuring that all students have the opportunity to thrive in the modern learning environment. I can lead out in my own community by gathering data on the current state of access to educational technology for families in my school district. I can identify gaps and disparities in access among different student groups. I will create awareness about the importance of equitable access to educational technology using various channels such as social media, community meetings, and newsletters to inform parents, educators, and policymakers. Further, I can collaborate with local organizations, businesses, and community leaders to build partnerships that can support initiatives for equitable access including technology donations, discounted services, or volunteer programs.
