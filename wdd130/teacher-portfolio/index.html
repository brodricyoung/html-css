            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Welcome to my professional teacher portfolio. In these digital pages, I invite you to explore seven learning and instructional standards for educators set by the International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE). These standards have provided a framework for innovative lesson planning, assessments, and collaborative work and they empower me with the knowledge I need to thrive as an educator in a technology-driven world. Throughout the pages, you will find a collection of artifacts, reflections, and evidence of this framework. This portfolio reflects my growth and commitment to the ISTE standards and to creating a nurturing environment for my students that fosters a sense of curiosity and a lifelong love for learning.

                <h2>Teaching philosophy</h2>
                <p>
                    Before I learned to read, I loved listening to my mom read stacks, very large stacks, of books to me every day. This daily ritual not only instilled in me a deep love for stories but also laid the foundation for my educational journey. Story time, as a cherished and formative experience, not only prepared me for the academic challenges of school but also equipped me with essential life skills.
                </p>

                <p>
                    As an educator, I recognize the enduring value of storytelling and its pivotal role in fostering a love for learning. While my personal connection to story time remains steadfast, I acknowledge that today's learners are navigating a world enriched with a variety of technologies. In this fast-paced, technology-driven era, my philosophy centers on harnessing these tools to enhance instruction and maximize the potential of every student.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Understanding that my attitude, actions, and teaching approach significantly influence the learning environment, I embrace the role of an innovative educator. In a landscape marked by rapid growth and constant change, I position myself as a perpetual learner, dedicated to continuous improvement. I view technology not as a substitute for traditional methods but as a powerful tool that, when used effectively, can amplify the learning experience. By weaving together the timeless magic of storytelling with the possibilities afforded by technology, I aim to cultivate not only knowledgeable individuals but lifelong learners who find joy and purpose in their educational journey.
